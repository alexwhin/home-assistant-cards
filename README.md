## Samsung Washing Machine Card

This card brings your washing machineâ€™s status to life with real-time animations. This card integrates seamlessly with Samsung SmartThings to reflect the current state of your washing machine, displaying whether itâ€™s off, on, or actively washing including a more "human readable" completion time.

### Screenshots

The following images illustrate the cardâ€™s appearance in different states:

| Idle State                                                            | Wash State                                                              |

## Ring Alarm Slim Card

This card visually displays the current state of your Ring alarm system and allows quick toggling between armed and disarmed modes. Using smooth animations, the card updates in real time to reflect transitions between states, including disarmed, armed (home or away), and arming. The footer animates when arming, providing a dynamic visual indicator.

### Key Features

- **Animated Footer**: Smoothly animates when the alarm is in the "arming" state.
- **Quick Toggle**: Tap to arm when disarmed and to disarm when armed.
- **Color-coded States**: Green for disarmed and armed at home, red for armed away, with dynamic changes based on the alarm state.
